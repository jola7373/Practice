  Welcome to <strong>JIHYE's</strong> <u>LIFE</u>
  <br>this is a website to introduce my coding life
  <p>I started writing code and learn about programming
    when I start my college. It was not easy for me.
    I did not enjoy learning at first and was thinking why I
    need this. But my programming life changed since I took one
    class. The professor taught me well and I was able to follow
    and I began to enfoy here is why I code.</p>
